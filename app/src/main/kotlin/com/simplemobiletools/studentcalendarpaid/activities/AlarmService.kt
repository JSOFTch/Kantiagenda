/*
* Start alarm in say dialog, ---- check if it still works after app is cleared
* then have pendingIntent start a receiver which will show a notification
*
* or
*
* Start alarm in Intent service,
* and continue as first
*
* So since it's the intent service's handler which don't sleep, it will handle the notification?
* Well it makes sense, - cos it can't be handled by the activity, right?
* So I guess we will rather start the broadcast receiver, the br will wait for alarm, and send
* broadcast when alarm fires, then the intent service picks it up...? or rather the IS is started
* by the BR and shows notification
* ...?
*
*
* Doesn't wake up screen
* Pass items through pending intent through receiver to intent service
* Test with context receiver &/ try removing manifest receiver - why because
* If your app targets API level 26 or higher, you cannot use the manifest to declare a receiver for
* most implicit broadcasts (broadcasts that do not target your app specifically).

* Add icon to edit menu,
